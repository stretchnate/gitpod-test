<h1>Welcome to my Gitpod Site!</h1>

<p>I'm making this change on a browser, I will commit it and hopefully be able to refresh the browser and see it pretty instantly!<br>
    <pre>Correction: I'm actually able to see the changes in the browser before committing them. Which is handy because then a developer does not have to commit changes that may break the code, they can still test as they develop!</pre>
    <strong>One dodwnside to this is if you don't commit your code in your workspace and don't pin your workspace you will eventually lose all code changes.</strong>
